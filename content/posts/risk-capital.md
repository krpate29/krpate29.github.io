*While originaly written as a letter to the Friends of Park Scholarships, this reflection explores how programs that eliminate our **relative** educational costs fundamentally transform our ability to take risks and pursue meaningful work.*

## The Hidden Value: Risk Capital

My name is Krish, and I am a Park Scholar in the Class of 2026. While the opportunities this prestigious program has provided have been life-changing in many ways, I want to share a perspective that often goes undiscussed: how programs that drive the cost of attendance down to zero or close to it fundamentally transform our ability to take risks and pursue meaningful work.

The impact of this transformation extends far beyond the obvious financial benefits. By removing the burden of university costs, these programs nurture something that is often overlooked but deeply American: **risk capital**. This country was built by individuals who decided to take risks and start ventures, whether it was funding groups to travel halfway across the world in search of resources (Virginia Company) or people starting their own businesses; America was built on risk capital.

## The Genius Paradox

When you see geniuses in the news, young prodigies with incredible minds, people often think, "Wow, that kid could solve cancer or create innovative technology or do something to push humanity forward." Yet, more often than not, you see them go into management consulting or banking or some other profession with lower societal utility.

Why is that so? Well, if you consider the cost of attending elite schools (more than half of students at schools like Harvard, Yale, etc. pay full price), you have a sizable amount of debt before you even start making money. Why pursue an exciting venture with a 90% chance of failure when you could take the respected yet institutional path like working at McKinsey?

It is similar to when people attend MBA programs hoping to become entrepreneurs. You know what stops most entrepreneurship? It is not a lack of talent but a lack of financial freedom. After taking on a $200,000 loan for the privilege of starting a business that will most likely generate no immediate income, who would take that risk?

## The Freedom to Pursue Purpose

The reason I mention this is because the Park Foundation removed any barriers I might have had; no debt, no obligations; allowing me to focus on what I am truly passionate about. I realized I am passionate about defense, and I decided to work at the National Security Agency after my freshman year.

If I had declined the Park Scholarship and gone to Duke instead, I would have had a $320,000 mountain of debt, and I can guarantee you that I would not have taken a $20-per-hour job, even if it was for one of the most impactful agencies in the world. The reason is that I would have never even considered it. When you do not have to overindex on finances, you are free to pursue passions and really think about what you want to do.

When I was at the agency, I was proud of the work I did every single day, and I understood what I was working for (the future and prosperity of America). Now, I am heading to xAI as a member of their technical staff supporting their government work, and I will be contributing to advanced AI solutions that strengthen national security.

## The Broader Impact

Without the Park program, I would have been yet another Computer Science major interested in working at whatever company was trending. Instead, I now have a sense of individuality and purpose that differentiates me from most, and I would not have gotten that without the Park program.

This principle extends beyond any single scholarship program. When students don't graduate with crushing debt, they can take calculated risks on meaningful work, pursue passions without financial constraints, consider opportunities based on impact rather than compensation, and develop a sense of purpose that transcends career advancement.

Programs that eliminate educational costs don't just provide financial support --> they provide **freedom**. This freedom is what allows talented individuals to become the leaders, innovators, and change-makers that society needs. It's not just about removing financial barriers; it's about removing the psychological barriers that prevent people from pursuing their highest potential.
