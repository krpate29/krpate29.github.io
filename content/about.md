<!-- I'm an incoming Member of Technical Staff at [xAI](https://x.ai), where I'll be developing and deploying secure AI solutions for federal partners. --> 
Previously, I was at [Palantir Technologies](https://palantir.com), where I engineered GEOINT exploitation applications for national security workflows. I've also conducted quantum research at [Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education](https://orise.orau.gov), worked on cryptographic optimization at the [National Security Agency](https://nsa.gov), and developed bioinformatics algorithms at [North Carolina State University](https://ncsu.edu).

I'm pursuing an accelerated Bachelors and Masters of Computer Science at North Carolina State University as a [Park Scholar](https://park.ncsu.edu/), with a focus on quantum computing, cryptography, and applied AI.

My blog should not be taken to reflect the views of any organization I'm affiliated with.
