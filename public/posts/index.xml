      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;origins-of-the-thought&#34;&gt;Origins of the Thought&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the rise of fine-tuning as a service, I have been reflecting on fine-tuning in general. Recently, I read a paper about a group at Morgan Stanley that fine-tuned Qwen models to perform well at writing Q code. Q is a programming language used in high-performance finance, but it sees limited adoption elsewhere, resulting in limited data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initial benchmarking revealed that the models underperformed, likely due to the scarcity of training data and their inability to meet specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflections-on-ai-in-education&#34;&gt;Reflections on AI in Education&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been considering the role of artificial intelligence in educational settings, specifically the unrestricted use of tools such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://chat.openai.com&#34;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gemini.google.com&#34;&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cursor.sh&#34;&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt; at the college, high school, or middle school levels. This discussion focuses not on assistive tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flintk12.com/&#34;&gt;Flint&lt;/a&gt;, which are controlled by educators, but on freely available independent AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an individual whose college experience occurred entirely within the AI era, I believe these tools will represent a net negative for a substantial number of computer science students. This perspective may appear ironic, but I view the optimal application of AI as benefiting those who already possess knowledge of abstractions, engineering principles, and relevant domains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Zero Cost Schooling Builds Purpose</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While originaly written as a letter to the Friends of Park Scholarships, this reflection explores how programs that eliminate our &lt;strong&gt;relative&lt;/strong&gt; educational costs fundamentally transform our ability to take risks and pursue meaningful work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hidden-value-risk-capital&#34;&gt;The Hidden Value: Risk Capital&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My name is Krish, and I am a Park Scholar in the Class of 2026. While the opportunities this prestigious program has provided have been life-changing in many ways, I want to share a perspective that often goes undiscussed: how programs that drive the cost of attendance down to zero or close to it fundamentally transform our ability to take risks and pursue meaningful work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
